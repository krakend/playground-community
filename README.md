KrakenD Playground
====
The KrakenD Playground is a demonstration environment that puts together the necessary pieces to get you started with our API Gateway, using example use-cases.

As KrakenD is an API gateway, we have added surrounding services:

- Internal and third-party services that feed the gateway
- Authentication/authorization examples, including JWT token-based authentication with Keycloak integration, a JWT token revoker, API-Key-based authentication, and basic authentication.
- Integrations with Grafana+Influx (metrics), ELK (log storing and visualization), Jaeger (tracing), and RabbitMQ (for async agents).

## Services
The docker-compose.yml includes the following services:

### The API Gateway!
On port `8080`, you have an instance of KrakenD Community Edition with several endpoints. Its configuration is available at `config/krakend/krakend.json`, including descriptive `@comments` for each endpoint.

### Fake API backend (Upstream)
On port `8000`, you have a simple fake API that provides raw data to the gateway. You can add or remove data by adding XML, JSON, or RSS files in the `data` folder.

It runs in [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Metrics, logs & tracing
KrakenD can export telemetry to several services; this demonstration has a few examples. After starting the service and calling some endpoints, you will see the activity in Jaeger, Grafana, and Kibana.

| Metrics | Logging | Tracing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Grafana** shows the metrics stored by KrakenD on InfluxDB (credentials: admin/admin)| **Kibana** shows the logs registered by Logstash and persisted in Elasticsearch | **Jaeger** shows the traces of the activity between the client and your end services, including times of hops.|
| URL: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)| URL: [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) | URL: [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686) |
|![grafana screenshot](assets/grafana-screenshot.png)|![Kibana screenshot](assets/kibana-screenshot.png)|![jaeger screenshot](assets/jaeger-screenshot.png)|

**NOTE**: To import a Kibana dashboard with some valuable metrics, run in the console the following command once all has started:

```shell
    $ make elastic
```

### Web client
This consumer of the API gateway is a simple Express JS application that interacts with KrakenD to fetch the data. All code is under `images/demo-app/`.

The client is a Single Page Application using the builtin [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) instance to generate JWT tokens.

**You don't need to install any npm locally**; the docker image will download and install the dependencies in the container.

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### The async agent
A RabbitMQ instance is ready to accept AMQP messages to be delivered to the gateway.

You can insert messages in the `krakend` queue at [http://localhost:15672/#/queues/%2F/krakend](http://localhost:15672/#/queues/%2F/krakend) (credentials: `guest`/`guest`) and see how the async agent picks them and delivers them.

### The JWT revoker
A simple implementation of a JWT revoker using the KrakenD remote [bloomfilter client](https://github.com/krakendio/bloomfilter).

More information about JWT revoking is available at https://www.krakend.io/docs/authorization/revoking-tokens/

It runs on [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

### The IdP
The playground includes a pre-configured Keycloak container with everything ready to go. This container acts as an Identity Provider (IdP) to demonstrate Krakend ability to properly validate JWT tokens issued by it.

There are two pre-generated users with different roles:
* `moderator / moderator`
* `reader / reader`

If you need to create new roles, users or configurations in the Keycloak instance, feel free to do so by browsing to the `krakend` realm administration panel: [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085/admin/master/console/#/krakend/users) (credentials: `admin`/ `admin`)

:warning: All the realm configuration changes done using the administration dashboard **won't be persisted** on container restart. For more information, check [here](./config/keycloak/README.md)

## Start the service

### Running the playground

To start the stack included in docker-compose
```shell
    $ make start
```

To follow the KrakenD logs after the complete stack is up & running
```shell
    $ make logs
```

To shut down the complete stack, removing all the volumes
```shell
    $ make stop
```

## Play!
Fire up your browser, curl, postman, httpie, or anything else you like to interact with any published services.

- Fake API: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- KrakenD API Gateway: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- Jaeger (tracing): [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686)
- Kibana (logs): [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)
- Grafana (metrics): [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
- Sample SPA for auth: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- JWT revoker: [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
- Keycloak (IdP): [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085)

When you change the `krakend.json`, the changes are applied automatically.

| ðŸ’¡ Bonus track - Flexible configuration |
| --- |
| We've added an example of [flexible configuration](https://www.krakend.io/docs/configuration/flexible-config/), so you can view how it works in practice. <br><br> Apart from the default config file, `krakend.json`, you will find a `krakend-flexible-config.tmpl` that includes some code snippets, invokes a template using variables, and show some basic logic (iterations & conditions). <br><br> When working with the flexible configuration, you can optionally ask KrakenD to save the "compiled" output to a file. We've added a command `make compile-flexible-config` so you can see quickly and easily how KrakenD builds the final configuration file based on the existing templates.<br><br>Internally KrakenD's flexible configuration uses [Golang templating syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#hdr-Examples). |

## Editing the API Gateway endpoints
To add or remove endpoints, edit the file `krakend/krakend.json`. The easiest way to do it is by **dragging this file to the [KrakenD Designer](https://designer.krakend.io/)** and downloading the edited file. If you move the downloaded file to `krakend/krakend.json` the server will apply the changes automatically.

The following endpoints are worth noticing:
